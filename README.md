# LyricalPasswordGenerator
Generates passwords using the first letters to the lyrics of your favorite songs. 

In theory I want users to be able to input their Spotify username and it'll generate them a password using the first letters to the lyrics of a song in their library.
Also allowing them to shuffle to the next song if its not a memorable enough one for them.
